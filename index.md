## About Me

Hi, I am Jason Yan! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Information  at University of Michigan (UMSI), advised by Sabina Tomkins. My current research interest focuses on how we can leverage LLMs to measure subjective constructs for the purpose of providing high quality labels in data acquisition settings, such as annotation tasks. Before my Ph.D., I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University at Buffalo, where I was advised by Kenny Joseph.
